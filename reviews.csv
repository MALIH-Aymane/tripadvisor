3.0,"We visited this small garden in Marrakech after having visited several others in the area. It was expensive and we had a timed ticket which we bought on line the previous week and the site wouldn't let us buy tickets to the 2 museums as it said there were none left. On arrival we asked about museum tickets and they were available -lots of people buying them. The gardens them selves are in majorelle blue which is the garden's distinctive feature, however the gazebos were full of people queuing to have their photographs taken with views of the various water features. There is little underplanting of the various palms and little originality in any feature. The bamboo were fine. The over crowding is due to bus tours coming in from all of Morocco.",Over Rated Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2020,,Ethelberga H,"Grantham, UK,646 contributions",,"Written February 15, 2020"
3.0,"This is quite a nice garden on a property once owned by Yves St Laurent. Long queues to get in, but if you go down to the YSL museum and buy a combo ticket the queue is much shorter and you then get to walk straight into the gardens and Berber Museum without the wait. The Berber Museum is well worth it. There are some wonderful artifacts there and a lot of interesting historical information.  The lighting is very poor, so if you want to read the info sheets take your best reading glasses. The YSL Museum is a waste of money unless you like modern art. There are a range of YSL dresses and accessories to look at.  I’m not into that sort of thing so didn’t spend more than 10 mins there. The gardens are peaceful and a nice chance to sit away from the crowds of the Medina.   You don’t need more than an hour to do all three. Total cost on the combo ticket is 180 dirhams. I don’t think the whole gardens/museum complex is worth queueing an hour for though.  If you are short of time you won’t really be missing anything spectacular. It’s a pity it’s not just possible to see the Berber Museum by itself, as that was the best bit.",Quieter area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jan 2020 • Solo,,Joanne S,"Perth, Australia,102 contributions",,"Written January 6, 2020"
4.0,Avoid the queue by buying the combined ticket from the YSL museum (it's not a big museum you're basically paying extra to avoid the queue). The gardens were bigger than I was expecting and they're well cared for with that beautiful blue building which now houses the Berber museum (again not big but with an interesting design especially the jewellery room).

3.0,The garden itself is lovely and very beautiful.

4.0,"One definitely feels transported out of Marrakech into glorious green gardins when walking through the Jardin Majorelle, which hosts some unique looking trees, and plants. This is a nice way to spend a morning or afternoon though I do not know how much entrance cost because it was included in our tour. If the entrance fee is hefty... one might wish to reconsider unless they truly have an interest in this type of attraction. There are parks and gardens in every city and I would think a traveler might be more interested in the more unique aspects of this city especially if the price tag is heavy.

5.0,"We escaped to this oasis on a hot afternoon in June. Really liked the fact that you could get a combination ticket for the Yves Saint-Laurent museum, gardens and Berber Museum, and we spent a couple of hours exploring it all (and you could easily spend more time in the garden). Loved the water features and the walking paths. Read a bit about the history of Majorelle (and YSL and Bergé for a full appreciation). Would definitely return on future visits to Marrakech.

5.0,"Not realising that we should have booked in advance before we left the UK, we followed advice to arrive at the garden early - 8.30 a.m. and found only half a dozen people in the queue ahead of us. We were able to wander in peace for an hour before the coaches arrived!  We skipped the crowded cafe (good decision) and headed to the adjacent YSL Museum at around 10.30 and with our combined tickets were able to dodge the already lengthy queue. I can honestly say the Museum blew us away! The design of the building and the way in which  the exhibition of designs, films and biography has been curated was enthralling.  We found the cafe here excellent - smart, quiet, and not as pricey as it looks.

5.0,"Beautiful gardens with stunning colours and a most eclectic mix of plants and trees. Resist the temptation to take photos every 5m and just enjoy the beauty of this garden. Best to arrive early, as once it gets busy, the garden does feel a little crowded. Also, if you weren't able to buy online, the earlier you arrive, the shorter the queue for tickets!!

5.0,"I love the tranquillity of Jardin Majorelle and have visited many times over the years. However, although the garden itself has never disappointed, I’ve always felt troubled by the amount of graffiti, often declarations of love, that vandals had carved on to the bamboo trees and wondered why staff had not been sufficiently vigilant to prevent this from happening. Anyway, visiting recently, I found that various changes had been implemented, including staff being far more visible than in the past and an obligatory online booking system being in place (you can no longer pay on arrival). However, the one change that gave me the most joy was finding that all the graffiti had been removed from the bamboo trees. I guess that the presence of more staff, who were strategically placed along a prescribed route that visitors were encouraged to follow, would prevent future vandalism. These gardens are so serene and spending an hour here, especially when there’s few people around, feels like being in paradise.",The graffiti has gone!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or10-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Nov 2023 • Friends,,Susan A,"Matlock,942 contributions",,"Written January 29, 2024"

2.0,"Look, I think it’s worth the visit because it’s a bit of tranquility outside the bustling city, although it is definitely overpriced.  You can walk there from the Medina. There are not many species of plants and almost no identification labels so I wouldn’t really call this a botanical garden. There are security guards everywhere making you stick to a path like cattle, even though there are paths going left and right.  Nope, you must follow everyone else.  And it’s quite small. But here’s the main problem.  It’s a nightmare of people trying to get instagram photos next to something half decent to make it look like they are the only one there.  So there are queues and queues of people who want to all get the same photo at every possible nice looking thing.   So if you just want to take a normal photo of a pretty building, you can’t because there is someone pretending to be a model in front of it.  It’d absolutely relentless. If you find a nice place to sit and try to admire the scenery for a few minutes, people will literally notice you and then stand around waiting for you to get up so they can sit there and get a photo. 3 out of 5 and that’s being generous.   Go there to laugh at the people pretending to be models.  It’s probably more entertaining than the plants.",Instagram cattle yard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or10-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jan 2024 • Couples,,TheBirdWhoToldYou,"Mackay, Australia,38 contributions",,"Written January 24, 2024"

4.0,"This is Marrakech's No 1 tourist attraction. Book online a few days in advance and avoid disappointment. The garden was first formulated in 1923 by Jacques Majorelle (hence the name). After many decades it was purchased by the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and there is a memorial in the garden dedicated to him. You walk through a series of walkways around the garden which is well stocked with numerous types of cactus and bamboo's as well as indiginous plants.  There are beautiful ponds throughout the gardens and some wonderful houses all painted in electric blue. The downside is that it is very crowded, even with pre-booked tickets we had to queue 45 minutes to get in and you cannot walk freely around the gardens, there is a particular route  you walk which I presume is due the crowds. There is a  wonderful bookshop and upmarket shop at the end of the tour that caters for designer gifts and coffee books.

We were prepared on our return to Marrakech, and easily got tickets the day before our visit, for the time we wanted. Not a cheap venue, especially if you go for the combined museums’ ticket, but we came away with the view that it was worth it.  We spent a good few hours in the garden, as the Berber/Amazigh museum is within the area…..sometimes just sitting on the numerous benches, and just revelling in the views.  We sort of went round twice, as we realised we had missed areas, and this did not present a problem to the security staff.  The gardens are really beautiful, and there are a myriad of photo opportunities…. Even if you have to avoid the Instagram/Facebook selfie aficionados…. particularly impressive is the use of colour.  Sadly the plant identifications weren’t as helpful as they might have been.  Some had no labels at all, which is a pity, but others might have been included in a group identification board….

There are and were years ago the very obvious signals of disrespect for anyone other than the French such as the complete dismissal of anyone who speaks any other language (all museum exhibitions are written only in French).

It was especially annoying when I just wanted to use the bathroom.🤦‍♀️😂 However, the buildings are an incredible blue with yellow and Oka colours and fantastic for taking photos and the assortment of cacti and palm trees and water features are delightful.

It's also really unhelpful that you can't buy tickets in person at all anymore, only in advance through the website. Both of the museums were pretty average.

I found the Berber museum most interesting - it gives a great illustration of how Berber culture is quite different to Arabic culture, something I was unaware of before I visited Morocco. I also had no idea that Yves Saint Lauren is considered such an important figure in Marrakech.

Buy your timed-entry tickets in advance on-line, and get to the garden EARLY. It is extremely popular and even by 10AM there can be long line-ups. The joint ticket that includes the Berber Museum and the YSL Museum is worth the extra few dollars. Note that the best experience will include access to the Villa Oasis garden (a separate garden on the same property), which is only open Friday to Monday. While many reviews will tell you that you only need an hour to see all of this, I suggest that is way too little time to appreciate it. If your objective is to rush about taking selfies with large cacti, by all means - give yourself an hour or so. But to actually enjoy the place, I suggest at least a couple of hours. Jardin Majorelle has a cafe (we didn't try it) and there are several just outside the Jardin on Rue Yves St. Laurent.",Jardin Majorelle is lovely - so take the time to enjoy it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or80-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Oct 2023 • Couples,,WJP89,"Ottawa, Canada,540 contributions",,"Written November 1, 2023"

As other reviews have said, it's mainly good Instagram content. While there are some nice features, the layout of the garden was pretty poor with no real discernable sections or flow.  The cacti were cool but otherwise plants were just bamboo and ferns which are common in other Moroccan gardens that are much cheaper. We went at 11am and it was packed with people, so you can only sort of shuffle along- not particularly relaxing. Architecture was also disappointing- it's just that the buildings are painted a vibrant blue more than any interesting structureor design. Buying tickets online was also a nightmare for international travellers as when purchasing the site/bank sends a code to your home registered number which you can't do if you aren't using international roaming.

1.0,"I must say, I am neither a great garden expert nor I do have an Instagram account. With this being said, I really cannot understand the hype behind. I do not have any problem with the queuing and the timeslots, if you do your homework before going you just know how it works. The price is on the very high scale for the tickets in Morocco, hence I have been expecting something mindblowing - which is the case if you have an Instagram account and you really need to brag about your Morocco vacation. Walking in the garden is just waiting for dozen of people looking for the perfect shot - not caring one bit about whatever the garden is. Not that it is easy to understand what the garden is, as there is basically no explanation anywhere. The cherry on the cake was requiring to get an additional ticket for getting into the house/museum, I might sound cheap but after spending maybe 15€ entrance (by far the most we paid in Morocco) - this was just a joke. On top of that, the garden is not that close to the Medina, hence you will also need to get a cab to go there. In a nutshell, I cannot really blame ""the garden"" for being an Instagram Hotspot and I do not expect them to push out people monopolizing spots for 15 minutes looking for the perfect spot. But the price is way too high for what you get. There are beautiful gardens you can visit for free in Fes and Rabat, and better ones in Marrakesh like the Secret Garden. P.s. Just removed two stars - when checking the price I realized that they send you an account confirmation with your password in clear text. In 2023. I mean, seriously?

This garden is unlike anything I've visited before (and we're RHS and National Trust members!). The design and planting is exquisite. While the plants are mostly shades of green, the structures are vivid colours, especially blue and yellow, and the combined effects of foliage, cacti, palms, bamboo, water lilies, climbing bougainvillea are breathtaking.

4.0,"This is my third time visiting the garden since 2010 and the experience has changed in some important ways. We took about an hour just visiting the gardens (we skipped the museums). Most notably, as earlier reviews noted, you can ONLY buy tickets online in advance now, not in person, and you must pick a half-hour time slot to enter. This is new and it's presumably to avoid what had apparently become round-the-block lineups to enter, which would be dangerous in the summer heat (it was 40+ celsius this week). Make sure you have your actual tickets on your phone, not the email confirmation of your purchase. At the same time, the price has doubled to 150 Moroccan dirham per adult, easily way more than any other sight in Marrakesh. It's also on the verge of being overwhelmed by crowd control. Aside from the timed tickets, there are guards standing at certain paths telling you not to go this way or that way, which unfortunately undermines the experience of wandering and discovering the gardens on your own, as you once did. The other annoyance is of course the crowds themselves. We were there in June, which seems to be the beginning of low season, so there were still areas that were pretty quiet, but any of the obvious places to take photos have awkward clusters of people all waiting to take the same picture. If you just want to actually take in the view and examine the details of the garden, you're at risk of someone breathing down your neck, waiting for you to move so they can pose. Again, it sort of defeats the purpose of the gardens. It remains a beautiful place, fun to explore, and inspiring for anyone who likes design and landscaping. Among other highlights, you'll be surprised at the sheer variety of cacti in the section near the exit. If you're in Marrakesh, there's no reason to skip it, especially as it's different from the typical medina sights. But if you want your own pictures, give yourself plenty of time and plan on being patient with impatient people.","Beautiful place, but slightly overshadowed by crowd control",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or150-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jun 2023 • Couples,,BobPraz,"Toronto, Canada,231 contributions",,"Written June 29, 2023"

1.0,"We have seen the pictures of the garden online and we found it was cute and maybe worth spending an afternoon there. It started with the tickets. On the way out of the hotel we mentioned where we go. We were told we would not get in without tickets bought online. Then we tried to buy with the museum together, it was not available, then going back to the garden alone it was. What we did not realize was that the month jumped to July instead of June. Upon arrival we were told it is our fault and there is nothing they can do. An unfriendly cashier offered to change them for the next day. We explained that we are leaving Marrakech next morning so we can’t come back. She said if we had a flight ticket to show she would maybe reconsider. Since we traveled by car that was a lost case. I offered to show the next hotel reservation but she was stiff like a stick. Since we already wasted the afternoon to get there we bought another set of tickets. Then the true horror started. “Stand here”. “Move there”. “Left side of the sign”, “not so far left”. Real military regime or high security prison. Only guns and the barbed wire was missing. At 16:02 (two minutes after time despite the terror) we were admitted in. Not better there. A guard every few meters. “Move over”, “one person at the time”, “don’t stand here”, “keep moving”. The nazi guards with a dead serious faces were pushing the crowd towards the exit. Each group has 30 minutes (here 28) to stream through and depart before the next group. I was so angry with the entire experience that I barely took a picture there. Just rushed towards the exit to have this nasty event behind me.

But what really stuck out as this was at the end of our 10 day trip was how rude the security were from the second we got there. I understand it’s a tourist destination for sure but our driver tried to drop us off where he always drops off his people and the security outside was yelling at him and holding my door shut. It seemed overly aggressive as there wasn’t anyone waiting behind us. Outside they want your ticket but it was not clear where that ways. The first individual was super rude and just keep saying “that’s not your ticket, where’s the ticket.” Finally someone helpful did come over, for us connected to wifi and helped us get the tickets. Inside wasn’t much better. They were just very rude in how they told people things and it was a turn off. We wished we could have done the Berber museum but it wasn’t clear when buying tickets so we didn’t get to see that. We were done within an hour. The gardens themselves are not that large. I gave it a 3 because they are nice, cool, clean gardens but they could work ok some kindness in their manner of speaking with people.

The only problem was the behaviour of the security guards checking the tickets.  We were part of a mainly young photography group from many parts of Europe.  For some reason, the guard got it into his head that one of the young people had used her ticket before. This was impossible because we were part of an organised tour.

No tickets available at the site, so beware. 150d (about £12.50) per adult. Beautiful extensive gardens to wander with amazing variety of cacti and other plants. Shady and tranquil. Each entry group starts on the half hour, so wait a few moments on a bench once inside and relax and let them all pass you - then you get to stroll around and enjoy in relative peace!

3.0,"The garden is quite small and aside from the blue building and arches there really isn't much more to it aside from a few cactus and exotic plants. It gets very crowded so expect to wait in line for a while at your entry time before you actually get in. Perhaps social media may have boosted the popularity so it in turn there is a lot of footfall meaning essentially having to que to take pictures at each of the iconic spots. The berber museum is unbelievably tiny and you get ushered through at speed so probably spent no more than 5 minutes in there. Also there are barely descriptions and captions in English, so if you are not a fluent French speaker, good luck. If you run into any issues, the staff are generally rude and unhelpful. I purchased a ticket for both the gardens and berber museum for my party. Entry to the garden was fine however we were refused entry to the museum on the basis that out tickets had allegedly been used before. The guard at the door was rude and unsympathetic treated us like criminals and would not assist us in any way not even allowing us to take a picture of the error message to investigate further with the company we booked with. It definitely put a dampner on the day and eventually after 15mins of being held outside he let us in however we had to board our coach in 5 minutes so it was pointless. Advice: book everything directly and book transport seperately as there are many companies looking to scam and charge a premium for tourists desiring convenience through booking packages. Overall as I said the gardens are nice, but don't expect too much or more than you see in pictures as that is really all there is to it. I am sure there are more exciting gardens to explore in Marrakech such as Le Jardin Secret but unfortunately I found this out too late in my trip.",Pretty garden but overrated,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or260-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Apr 2023 • Friends,,MT_2618,"London, UK,8 contributions",,"Written April 7, 2023"

Oh, you can go to one of the many beautiful parks and gardens that are carefully curated by the city and are completely free to get in. For example, crypto Park, which, despite its name is utterly delightful. The number of tourists allowed on each visit to Jardin Majorelle detract from the experience. On the day I visited I had paid both for a visit to the gardens and also to the museum. I was part of the last visit of the day, but no one told me on entrance that I needed to be at the Museum door before 4:30 pm. There was a huge group of Spanish tourists, who not only blocked pathways, slowing down the floor around the gardens, but also took up the museum. Ali visit allocation of 30 people. At 4:30 pm I was at the Museum door, but was told there were no more visits that day. I didn’t get a refund or even an apology! As advised by the workers, I contacted the Directa by telephone.

It's a 30 minute walk from the center of Marrakech or a short taxi ride so easy to get to but is in a busy area so not a retreat from the full on intensity of the Medina. Booking on line is essential as you can't walk up and get in. When you are in its too small and overcrowded to enjoy. The flora is impressive and the Berber artifact is interesting up to a point. If you don't speak French or Arabic you won't know what most of it means though and there is just to little going on to justify the £30 combined ticket cost per head.

Visited the Jardin Majorelle cafe instead.  Drinks were nice but service was poor. Had to ask three times for the bill and still didn’t get it. Had to go and pay at the till (which they didn’t like). When we left the cafe the door was closed to visitors because the place was too full. Overpriced for what it is. Not a pleasant experience. Took a taxi to walk around the free and peaceful Menara Gardens instead. The Secret Garden (Jardin Secret) within the Medina is lovely and a much better experience.

Not only is the line gonna be long unless you book an early ticket, but an angry employee will be walking back and forth along the line, scolding you for standing in line and making you leave the line unless you've ordered for a certain time slot – as if you had any way of knowing what time slot everyone else's tickets are for.

Yves Saint Laurent knew beauty, and this garden reflects that. Even in the bustling new city, the traffic fades away inside the walls. We stopped for plenty of photos along the way, of course.

3.0,"Oh my gurd, where to begin! We precooked a joint ticket for both the YSL museum and the garden/jard-in. When we arrived the queue for the garden was absolutely massive and so we instead headed to the YSL first, please see my review on that page if you're interested about the museum! After we had finished up in the museum we headed back to the garden and the queue was gone, we were impeccably confused! It was like someone had come along with a hoover and sucked everyone up, however when we left the queue had returned to it's previous humungous stature so I think it's very hit or miss when it comes to the queue! Once inside of the bodacious garden/jard-in Helen and I were suddenly overcome with emotions as we're immediately greeted by the most gorgeous and ravishing bamboo tree and oh it was just so winsome! If you know me, you know I love bamboo so this was a treat and a half! As we progressed through the botanically fetching jard-in we see the most darling water feature where you can stand in a little structure and admire the water. HOWEVER, this is where my biggest peeve found its way into the day, the crowds! Hecking hell, there were pesky people everywhere you go, like pigeons! And if that wasn't bad enough, they were all preposterous posers! Which meant that I couldn't even look at the features because everyone fancied themselves rather too much, well not everyone but a select few. I'd like to disclaim that I don't have an issue with people taking photos with the stupendously awesome backdrops however it was a little excessive and taking the George Michael a bit when they start trying 50 different poses, but each to their offensive own am I right?! We saw the botanically blue house thing which oh my Gordon Brown, it was to die for! Helen couldn't help but pose with the velvet blue house, however the squitters had struck me so I couldn't bring myself to smile. But there were the most gorgeous cacti and glazing green colours towering over me so I was in awe, I wish I was there with better bowels to be honest. Although bowels aside it was pretty damned beautiful. It is this point where myself and Helen were struck the most, after the house is another quaint little pond thing. There was a darling but somewhat rudimentary woman stood there posing which was fine, until she insisted upon about 20 different poses and 100 different photographs. Helen decided enough was enough and barged through and peeked at the flapping fish, unfortunately I missed out on seeing the fishies. All in all the jard-in was just spectacularly breathtakingly beautiful, but it was very much tainted by the displeasurable disturbances of business and not enough viewpoints. Another example is some posers on a path, meaning we couldn't go anywhere and they took about 5 minutes and didnt even apologise, how rude am I right?! Oh and by the way, they have coi karps! Thank you to Helen and the Jard-in majorette team for making this divine trip possible. I wish you all the best and I'm sure you'll take on my feedback.

The garden is connected to the museum, which I wish we would have visited first as both were crowded but I think it would have been better at the museum had we gone there first.

It's not so much about the garden as the boldness of the YSL / Majorelle blue painted onto the artists studio, the light as it creates added drama and intensity against the sky and the lush planting. The Berber museum within the grounds is also beautifully presented under a dark ceiling of twinkling lights and each object is illuminated with added impact. 100 yards down the road is the YSL museum which is a must see also and this garden is a testament to his creative genius.

1.0,"TOURIST BEWARE OF SCAMMERS AND THIEVES AND EXPECT TO BE DISAPPOINTED. How this is the number 1 tourist spot, I don't know. Granted there are some nice palms and cactus here but the overall experience is nothing special and really just a waste of money. As this city lack real authentic culture you are effectively forced into going to visit this site as a basic checklist list activity due to the limited things you can do in Marrakesh. You will pay £32 Entrance to basically walk through a garden centre of cactus plants!!! If you have time to kill then check it out but like much of Marrakesh this isn't much to see nor is there any real culture to experience. Some of you may think there will be some real photo opportunities but this is not true. The reason why this is the number 1 spot is simply due to the influence the YSL foundation has over the tourist board and government. Which inadvertently aim to drive tourist traffic to this site. Yes this may be the best botanical garden in Morocco but remember you are in a desert where green space is scarce. See it might be a refreshing change to see greenery when you are surrounded by grime, pollution and red bricked buildings. Expect long queues outside the venue. Approx 1 hour 30mins. Admission with get you into the ysl museum but again nothing special. Clean toilets though if you need it. If you walk from the town centre souks/ markets to Ysl garden it will take approx 30mins. You can take a cab but do not pay more than 30dhs. Taxi will say minimum fare is 50dhs. FYI is you take trips over 10km expect to pay no more than 100dhs or £10.

The most surprising thing was that for such a crowded attraction, there are just 2 toilets for the whole garden. Portacabins with a woman who jumps in to clean them after every single person.

3.0,"I was really fortunate the day I chose to visit the garden as I arrived soon after it opened and it wasn’t busy. I chose the combined ticket which meant I got to see Le Jardin Majorelle, The Berber museum and the YSL museum. I have to say that although the garden is nice and the colours, particularly the vivid blue, instagram worthy, I don’t really believe it is deserving of all the hype it receives. This is just my personal point of view. It’s a nice garden but it wasn’t my favourite garden in Marrakesh. I think there are nicer ones, including Le Jardin Secret, that seemed far less touristy but again it was quiet when I visited. I am still glad I visited Le Jardin Majorelle to make up my own mind. I found the Berber museum interesting and informative. I also saw the cafe in the garden but decided to walk down the street to the YSL museum and in doing so found a wonderful cafe just before the entrance to the museum that I had to myself. The outside seating area was pretty with flowers and a peaceful area to enjoy a drink.

It’s necessary to join a long queue to buy a ticket (for us, one hour), then join another queue to get in. For us, about 40 minutes. This queue competes for entry with those holding online tickets. And tour groups have priority over all! The gardens were completely overwhelmed by demand and had to work on a one in, one out arrangement. To cap it all 120MAD each without entry to the museum. In all honesty, the gardens are not that spectacular and certainly not worth the queuing and the cost. Once in it’s a bunched-up one way system.

The Berber Museum is fascinating though the lack of any english labelling was somewhat inconsiderate towards us anglophones whose french craft words are somewhat limited.

2.0,"Jardin Majorelle. Glad we went, but somewhat underwhelmed and thought MAD120 each for the gardens plus MAD30 each for the Beber Museum was way overpriced. We would have given three stars, but the price pulls it down to two for us. There are some amazing plants in the garden, but to quote my husband it is ""overworked"" so more of a plant display than a garden. Lacking life and soul. Not sure when the bamboo fencing was installed, but it is not fitting. I wonder what the garden was like in Majorelle's lifetime. I hope a lot less ""sterile"". The Berber Museum had some interesting pieces, but was too dark. Maybe we had been spoiled by our recent visit to the Gulbenkian in Lisbon, which was a truly amazing place, needing far more than the one day we had to really appreciate it. My husband wished that he could have seen how Majorelle's studio had looked. As it houses the Berber Museum that is not possible. The villa that normally has paintings in was closed for renovations, so no chance of seeing any artwork. Pleased to have gone and think we were lucky that (due to the effects of the pandemic on tourism) it was very quiet, but in many ways the walk there and back (About 40 mins each way) from our hotel in the medina was more interesting. Won't be rushing back.",Overpriced and underwhelming,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or800-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Sep 2021,,Su M,7 contributions,,"Written September 29, 2021"

It’s a beautiful exhibit yet I found it ended to fast. I was there for a maximum of 25 minutes and I took lots of pictures.

I bought the adult combined ticket at the ticket office because I'd planned on going to the YSL Museum and Gallery afterward. The Majorelle House and all of its grounds with its gardens are very pretty indeed and I love blue anyway however it was packed in there on that particular day. The museum in the house itself is a museum that preserves the history of the Berber people and photography isn't allowed inside of the museum. I liked the arts and crafts including metalwork that were being preserved by the museum. I love the gallery, book shop and gift shop - the items they sell are amazing and I wanted to buy practically everything! If I had the time during that day I would have stopped in the pretty outdoor cafe in the Majorelle House and Gardens but I only took a couple of quick pictures of the cafe instead. The cafe's tables were packed on that day too.

4.0,"The key to visiting the Jardin Majorelle is to go as early as possible, when it's cooler and the place is not overrun with the self-obsessed.  There are plenty of nice photos to be had, but only before it gets too crowded. We didn't visit the YSL museum through choice, but the Berber museum was very interesting and for us worth the small extra fee; it was just a little sad that photographs in there were banned and there was no leaflet available with photos to help us recall the interesting exhibits that we saw. A key point: The gardens of the Villa Oasis are not well signposted, nor are they mentioned on the leaflet available at the ticket office.  Worse still, on the day we visited they only opened a little later, and folk were standing in line waiting for them to open.  One wonders how many visitors see the Majorelle and come out without seeing or knowing about the Villa Oasis gardens. This attraction is definitely worth a visit, but if you don't go early, be prepared to be sickened by the narcissism and selfishness of the other visitors.  The books say it gets quieter near closing time, so if you can't rise early, try that.",Go very early to beat the narcissists!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or890-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Mar 2020,,Alan P,"Gateshead, UK,29 contributions",,"Written March 21, 2020"

2.0,"A lot is made of this being a ‘must-do’ in Marrakech. I disagree. I feel it is more a ‘can-do’ if you are bored walking the endless Medina. It costs MAD 70 (about US$9) just for the garden( extra 110 to also visit the museum which is about a block away. The 30-minute lines to buy a ticket seem to be always there, and you only get shade about half the time. The garden itself is honestly just meh. Very crowded, with at least 10-20 people in line to get a picture at specific spots. The plants are all desert varieties of palm trees and cacti from all over the world, but unless you are a serious succulent geek, they are just spiny plants. There is a Koi pond with about 10 fish. You walk this crowded cement walkway around the garden and then you’re out. There is a Berber museum inside the garden which costs an extra 10 and I skipped. Bottom line, some nice benches in the shade to sit at for a lot of money and after a long line.",Just ok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or930-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Mar 2020 • Family,,Gabriel M,"Palo Alto, CA,198 contributions",,"Written March 12, 2020"

Finally I have to say, that in Marrakech this is a must to come here. Nicely kept, well organized, rich fauna with interesting history behind. I loved the wide variety of cactuses, the bizarre combination of colors, especially the green and majorelle blue gives some special atmosphere to the place. It is recommended to buy a combined ticked to see also the Berber museum - what is located in the Majorelle garden - and  the Yves Saint Laurent exhibition next door.

Taxi is only 50 Dirrhams from the main square for 4 people - don't let them charge you more.,Simply beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or1030-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2020,,johall2017,"Reigate, UK,5 contributions",,"Written February 25, 2020"

It doesn’t take long to get through, but the quality of its exhibits/artifacts is outstanding. The restoration/preservation of the buildings and gardens were a gift from YSL and his partner to Marrakesh - and they are simply beautiful. It’s fairly peaceful for Marrakesh, and a nice break. But I’ll echo what another reviewer said, I wasn’t always impressed with the behavior of staff, and opted to go somewhere else for coffee. Not all staff, but too many seem far more interested in talking to each other than helping visitors. Still, very worth your time and money.

It's horribly overcrowded defeating the purpose of visiting to enjoy a peaceful garden.  The blue bits are very pretty and this must have been a lovely place to live as a private residence but it's way too small to accommodate the demand and the customer service is a complete failure. There are some nice frogs in the pond.  That was definitely the best bit. I felt very disappointed by this place on so many levels.  Thanks to the frogs for being awesome.

He physically insisted on taking my phone, and I eventually realized there is a deleted photo file that he was trying to get to to again delete the picture.  If he had told me that from the beginning i would have simply done it. He also went off about how Moroccans are very smart and I can’t help but wonder if he would have scrolled through pictures if I were male instead of female.

This attraction is not a Moroccan culture-type attraction; it is only a garden-type attraction.

2.0,"Yes the blue walls are amazing and the garden is somhow nice, however it is not worth the price. If you visit Marrakech for the first time, you need to see Jardin Majorelle but don't expect to be blown away. It's a cute garden with colourful pots and blue walls on one of the buildings. The trees are beautiful and all but again, it's not worth 70DH ! Also due to its popularity it's overcrowded and it's a literal fight to try and take a picture. Instagramers and Youtubers are fighting to take the best selfie and you might not want to join them so your experience will be poor... We went early ( around 9.30 and it was still overcrowded). We did it but won't be back and believe there are many other ways of using 70 DH ! You basically look at trees, cactus, ponds and a locked villa. The Berbere museum ( 30 DH ) was much more insteresting to us, unfortunately it was really small and overcrowded too. Maybe they should look into the amount of people allowed in at the same time because between the tourists, the numerous staff ( at every corner there is someone guardind...the trees? ), the children, the yourubers and all, it was not the relaxing walk in a garden that we expected!

There are three attractions here and each requires a ticket. You can get a combined ticket for all three. (180Drm) The Gardens. Lovely. Not as big as I imagined. Huge bamboo plants and others. This is a popular place for fashion photographers, so don't be too surprised at trendy photographers and posing models. The Berber Museum. Within the gardens. Yes ok for the small additional cost. It's worth it. The YSL Museum. Just along the street. To be honest, you need to be a bit of a fashion nut, but I was very impressed by the display of garments. Warning, photos really are not permitted, and they watch like hawks. If you're going to come here at all you may as well do this. Have lunch in the cafe.

The YSL Museum is also small but interesting: fab YSL dresses and a good temporary exhibition of paintings by Azema when we were there but again expensive: 100 Dirhams entry fee there.",Lovely planting and very good Berber Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or1320-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jan 2020,,Jo G,"Guildford, UK,251 contributions",,"Written January 8, 2020"

However we were directed to another counter where the queue was for people with children under 12, pregnant women and elderly or with disabilities. We had to wait for about 20-25 minutes in the queue. Children under 12 are free to enter the gardens. The garden itself is like an oasis, with huge cactus plants, palm trees, ponds etc. It’s really pretty. It takes you around 1 to 1.5 hour to explore it.

And unlike most of the city of marrakech these people are really trying to keep it in good shape. Aside of plants you can find a Berber museum, small but interesting enough to visit it - good thing it comes combined with a garden, on its own I guess number of visits to it would be low.

The Villa Oasis garden was slightly more interesting, but still massively overcrowded, and has more limited opening hours. It was really disapointing to see grafitti scratched in to many of the plants- dreadful destruction of the exhibits. The place was so crowded that walking around in the main garden was difficult.

Long queues to get in, but if you go down to the YSL museum and buy a combo ticket the queue is much shorter and you then get to walk straight into the gardens and Berber Museum without the wait. The Berber Museum is well worth it. There are some wonderful artifacts there and a lot of interesting historical information.  The lighting is very poor, so if you want to read the info sheets take your best reading glasses. The YSL Museum is a waste of money unless you like modern art. There are a range of YSL dresses and accessories to look at.  I’m not into that sort of thing so didn’t spend more than 10 mins there. The gardens are peaceful and a nice chance to sit away from the crowds of the Medina.   You don’t need more than an hour to do all three. Total cost on the combo ticket is 180 dirhams. I don’t think the whole gardens/museum complex is worth queueing an hour for though.  If you are short of time you won’t really be missing anything spectacular.

3.0,The garden’s are lovely but I’m slightly confused as to why this attraction is rated as no.1 in Marrakech on tripadvisor. They were nice to walk around but the queue was very long to get in (we actually came back later in the day when the queue had died down a bit) and very busy once inside which didn’t allow for the tranquil feeling of walking around gardens. It was also very expensive in comparison to other attractions in Marrakech- I don’t really understand why. A lot of the plants have been damaged by people carving their initials and names into them which is a bit of a shame.

5.0,Well worth a visit. Complete contrast to most of the other attractions in Marrakesh. Tip. If you wish to also visit the YSL museum ( a bit expensive but just about worth it) avoid the queues at the Marjorelle gardens and visit the museum first (at the far end of the road past the gardens entrance). Buy a combined ticket and on leaving the museum you can by-pass the ticket queues at the garden and walk straight in.,Lovely oasis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or1560-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Oct 2019,,AvidDiner473,"Newark-on-Trent, UK,247 contributions",,"Written December 1, 2019"

Yves-Saint-Laurent later bought the property and had it restored. He lived here until his death. His final resting place is within the garden. The garden is beautiful. My suggestion: come early, like I did, right at opening of 9 am!  The garden is very popular with tourists. They generally start arriving around 10. By then, you want to be gone!

4.0,"I'm not interested in YSL or that kind of fashion but the garden is worth visiting for three reasons... On a hot day it is very cool (literally) to walk around under the huge bamboo and trees. It's one of the 'must do' sites in Marrakesh. Just so you can say you've been there. Most interesting for me was the museum of Berber life. After spending a night in a berber camp in the Sahara I was fascinated to see and read about all of the exhibits here; clothing, weapons, cookware, jewellery etc. Unfortunately photography was not allowed in here. The best advice we were given was to go to Jardin Majorelle early and so we did. We arrived before 9am and there was just a short queue for tickets, while inside it was very quiet. However, by the time we emerged from the Berber museum at about 11am the whole place was very crowded, full of coach loads of tourists taking selfies in front of Cacti. Time to leave! And the queue for tickets to get in was huge. A good little exhibition is a small room with posters of the 'Love' greeting cards that YSL created every year and sent to his friends and collaborators. Finally, it's good to see security guards dotted around the gardens. A deterrent to the sad individuals who feel the need to carve their names into the leaves of the plants. It is worth visiting Jardin Majorelle, but go early in the day!",One of the 'To do' things in Marrakesh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or1600-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Sep 2019,,CoxieandBaggy,"Isle of Man, UK,898 contributions",,"Written November 25, 2019"

We spent several hours in the garden, transfixed by its magical beauty. The stunning YSL Museum is also breathtaking, featuring fully accessorized and clothed black mannequins, exhibiting the strong influence Moroccan colors and textiles had on YSL's design aesthetics.

4.0,Having bought ‘skip the line’ tickets my husband and I and our 18year old son spent an hour wandering in the lovely Majorelle gardens.  Fabulous collection of desert style plants providing lots of shade from the heat of the Moroccan sun.  There’s a winding path taking you through and a number of water features (some Koi fish too) reflecting the tall palm trees overhead.  Yves St Laurent’s house is within the grounds which you pay extra to visit.  It’s in that wonderful cobalt blue that started appearing in the UK gardening shows like Ground Force back in the 1980s.  It gets very busy later in the day so get there early otherwise you will be travelling at a snails pace.

The garden is well maintained, beautifully established and at this time of year we saw cacti in flower and lots of unusual desert flora. We visited mid afternoon, that was a mistake it was very busy and you could not get a clear photograph without people ahead of you. I think the 3 sights in a morning early would be worth the trip. Personally I preferred the more typical structure and moroccan colours of the 'Jardin Secret' just to the north in the Medina which was simply stunning and the information provision there is rather better.

Painter Jacques Majorelle's original studio has been transformed by Yves St-Laurent's partner Pierre Berge into a museum of Berber culture that ranks among the best ethnographic collections in the world. The magnificent tribal jewelry is strikingly displayed in a darkened, mirrored-ceiling room that quite literally dazzles. Costumes are no less impressive, offering a rare glimpse at full outfits of both daily and ceremonial wear. As to the gardens: early morning and late afternoon hours offer the best photographic possibilities, when the light is ideal and the hordes are reduced to a minimum. Regrettably, the flora bears the all-too-visible scars of deplorable visitors and lax security: graffiti has been carved into the palms and cactuses, spoiling the intended sense of a tranquil retreat from the madness outside the walls.","lovely gardens, magnificent museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or1750-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Oct 2019,,Kirk E,"Santa Fe, NM,1,053 contributions",,"Written November 4, 2019"

It was a great idea, only it was shared by a thousand other people, mostly Chinese looking for great pictures, of which the place has hundreds of perfect locations to get one. The gardens are lovely, well- laid out and a cool break from the Moroccan sun. The variety of plants and flowers is striking and altogether beautiful. Unfortunately, it was hard for us to really enjoy them because of the crowd, most of whom were jockeying for position to take a five second long photo session and move on. Regardless, we particularly enjoyed the cactus section, which has amazing specimens and the long reflective pond. The bamboos were stunning, although somewhat scarred by the initials of many visitors who left their brains outside.

Many new world cacti, agaves, paddle cacti somewhat resembling botanical gardens in Arizona. I felt like Alice in wonderland who had shrunk to mouse size. Now for the negatives, by 10 am the place was over run by hordes with no interest at all in the plants or garden and only cared about the •perfect• selfie. So annoying. Similar experience in the Berber museum in the garden, way to many people for the venue, which is small and well laid out but can’t reasonably accommodate a bus load of 50 tourists all entering at once. My advice be there 15 min before the garden opens and be one of the first in. Experience the quiet and birdsong. Note to the gardeners trapping and rehoming  the feral cats would be a huge bonus for the  birds. Once the bus loads start to pour in its time to leave.

What ends up is that the place is way too crowded. And everyone is making their narcissistic selfie pictures with the blue painted buildings and trim which stops you being able to just saunter around and enjoy.

The queue was much shorter (about 20mins) and it turned out it was possible to actually buy tickets for the YSL museum as well as the Jardin Majorelle there. We ended up getting a combi ticket to visit both as well as the Berber museum inside the Jardin Majorelle.

The place is undeniably beautiful, the vivid blue colours and lush green surrounds is definitely something to marvel at. Especially in a city that is rather covered in vast spans of stone and concrete type materials. It took us approximately 20 minutes waiting in line to purchase tickets, and that's only because we managed to line up in the better of the two lines (the other line moved far far slower). Once inside there was a large number of people wandering about, as you do, so it was rather difficult to get those 'signature insta-omg' worthy photos. However, if you're patient you'll get them. I have to say though, we spent just as much time inside as we did in line, so 40 minutes all up. Worth it? I'm still not sure. But I guess some of the photos I got were nice. Pro-tip: There is a sign at the end of the line that states you can get faster access by purchasing a combined ""YSL Museum and Jardin Majorelle"" ticket at the YSL Museum counter, which gives you priority access to the gardens.

The only downside is just how busy the garden is and getting caught behind visitors taking several photos whilst trying to get the perfect Instagram shot no doubt.",Beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2050-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Sep 2019 • Couples,,Mr D,84 contributions,,"Written September 25, 2019"

5.0,"On 22 Sep 2019 we went to visit the YSL Museum as many told us to go, and read about the Jardin Majorelle, which was an unexpected nice bonus. The tickets for the garden alone are 40 dirhams (~ 4€/5$). Which is not bad, considering the amount of maintenance the garden needs. We bought a combo ticket @ 180 dirhams (~18€/20$) which incl. the Berber Museum and YSL Museum (which after visiting - both are very small, I think the price is overrated). The garden is not big and you could walk it all in 15min or less due to the many tourists and photo opportunities you could spend about 30-45min here easily. If I had to choose I would combine it with the Berber Museum as this tells the story of the Nomadic Tribs of Marocco. And is more fascinating, then the YSL Museum. Going here is a nice walk outside of the Medina so you see something else as the souks. Worth visiting.",Beautiful garden within Marrakesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2050-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Sep 2019 • Friends,,RMDTraveller,"Zurich, Switzerland,387 contributions",,"Written September 24, 2019"

5.0,"These gardens have some amazingly shaped cacti, impressive bamboo plants and tall palm trees all set off by fantastic pops of colour. Large plant pots are painted orange, yellow etc and the wonderful Majorelle Blue shines through it all. The walkways (you can’t wander freely through the plants) are mostly wide and smooth. The downside is that there are so many Instagram worthy shots that you are often held up by people posing for the camera or wielding selfie sticks! The cafe is worth a visit-delicious ice-cream; you don’t have to order a full meal, and we told the waiter that we’d like to sit outside in the shade so he let us sit inside he could show us to a suitable seat. There are clean toilets in the garden for anyone to use - separate from the cafe. TOP TIP!!   The queues for the garden start early and move slowly at popular times - as we planned to visit the Yves-Saint-Laurent Museum as well, we walked further along the road, and bought a joint ticket there, the queue was short and moved quickly, then we walked back to the garden entrance and by-passed that queue to go straight in.",Beautiful Blue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2110-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Sep 2019 • Couples,,JackiePHC,"Wimborne Minster, UK,125 contributions",,"Written September 17, 2019"

5.0,I was very impressed and stunned when I entered the garden with my family. A vibrant red colour pathways takes you around a very tidy and well organised garden full of cactuses and palm trees. There is a memorial in one corner of the garden for Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge who was his partner. The little villa in the middle of the garden is painted with bright blue colour which is used widely in Morocco. The villa windows are opening to this beautiful water feature with beautiful lilies on the surface of the water. The villa is used for Berber museum and you have to pay extra on top of 100 Dirham for the garden. If you decide to visit this garden make sure you book YSL museum next door. The price for both is 170 Dirham (almost £16 each). The garden is not that big and 1 hour is enough to spend unless you want to seat on a bench and enjoy the view longer.,Beautiful oasis in middle of an African town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2160-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Aug 2019 • Family,,bahf,"Cambridge, UK,125 contributions",,"Written September 9, 2019"
2.0,"After being recommended this garden I had high hopes for a great and interesting experience. Sadly this attraction fell short on several accounts. Long queues of over an hour to buy tickets. Extremely crowded and too many people taking photos, selfies and generally getting in the way ruined the enjoyment for me. Sure the gardens are well maintained but not as beautiful as I expected and certainly not on par with other desert gardens I have previously visited. The only slightly redeeming aspect was the little cafe/restaurant in the centre that offered good service and tasty food, although that was a bit overpriced in comparison to other places. Sorry I can’t recommend a visit to here.

Beautifully coloured bungalows, covered walkways and buildings. Every meandering path is full of amazing views. However, once the tourist swarm the place, expect selfie sticks all around, instagram posers, people stopping randomly and stopping all traffic... The Berbere museum exhibits in a few room the traditions of the original inhabitants with their traditional tools and festive dresses/accessories (for only 30 DAM it is well worth paying the entrance fee!). The Majorelle boutique is worth a visit just to look at the floors and ceilings! Absolutely gorgeous.

4.0,"If you need a quick escape from the heat of the city, head towards the Majorelle Garden out to the west of Marrakech. Accessible from the City Tour bus (although it is an interminably long way round to get there!) The entry fee is reasonable, it's not as big a site as some tourist guides claimed, but that doesn't matter when it's plus 40 degrees C outside and you just want to get out of the sun. There are queues - they aren't long and there are mist sprays to keep you cool while you wait - and if you have younger kids it's likely that the security ushers will pull you out of line and fasttrack you through the group bookings kiosk if they're quiet. The gardens were a lovely peaceful haven from the chaos of the city - even when busy. A wonderful collection of bamboo grasses and succulents and - as we found - an excellent venue for the selfie-obsessed... it was difficult to move without inadvertently photobombing one of the many preening beautiful people looking for the perfect background but that was all part of the entertainment - a great place for people watching! The colours are vivid, there is a monument to former owner Yves St Laurent which almost takes on the status of a sacred pilgramage site and there's also a Berber museum within - although we didn't visit it. The cafe is quite expensive compared to other local offerings. I would recommend the Pause Gourmande just outside the exit if you want good value and tasty food. It will fill an hour or two of your day but not much more.

5.0,"This is a really beautiful garden, and definitely should be at the top of your list of must-dos while in Marrakech.  We stopped by right when it opened, and were lucky to be one of the first ones there.  I would highly recommend doing this, as we went again later in our trip in the middle of the day and found it super crowded with a very long ticket line and the good photo ops inside were swamped with people everywhere.  It was much nicer to go early-it was cooler, no line, and we could wander around and take photos of whatever we wanted without anybody else in the background.  The garden itself is actually smaller than I expected, but plan to spend an hour or two here just enjoying the beauty and taking photos.  The ""instagram models"" and photographers were out in full force when we went later in the day and it was a bit annoying, but you can avoid this by going early.  There's a decent little cafe inside, we didn't have food but we enjoyed coffee in the stunning setting.  We also really enjoyed the shop, it has some really unique items that are far better than the typical Marrakech souvenirs you'll see in the souks.

4.0,"I would say this is a pleasant distraction from the hustle & bustle of Marrakesh, but due to tourism, Jardin Majorelle is not the quiet utopia you would wish for. That being said, it is still a nice attraction that can still be looked at with a slower & more laid back approach than elsewhere. The queue to get in can take a while, but moves quick enough (even quicker if you have a child or even quicker if you book in advance). Once in, there are multiple directions & things to look at, which will keep even the least interested person occupied for a half hour. I am a big fan of bamboo, so was pleased with the amount on show. However, the graffiti on that & the cacti was a real shame.

I have reviewed that museum separately . Then you walk down the block and go into the gardens. There are lots of benches and balcony-type pull-outs for great photo opportunities. The gardens are like a botanical museum. All kinds of plants and trees both indigenous and from other countries. I was recently living and teaching in Mexico, so it was fun to see some indigenous plants from Mexico. The only downside is that it was crowded so it was difficult to get a shot without other people in it. You have to be patient and bide your time.

If you can avoid all the Instagram photos being taken, it's really lovely. Compared to the prices of most tourist activities like this in Morocco, in my opinion it was overpriced. We bought a ticket to all 3 elements – the garden, the Berber Museum and the Yves Saint Laurent museum. While I found the Berber Museum interesting, it was quite small and I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know by visiting small towns and other historic sites etc. Unfortunately, we didn't realise the Yves Saint Laurent museum was further down the road, and thought that a small room of artworks was the museum!

5.0,"Do NOT join the queue at the entrance to the gardens on Rue Yves-Saint-Laurent! Turn around the corner to the right side of the entrance and go to the ticket office for the YSL Museum (near Maroc n Roll). We went at peak time and were happily surprised to find no queue at the office (there was a massive 45 minute queue for those who didn’t know about the office). Once there get a ticket to the Berber Museum which also gives you access to the gardens and ultimately saves you buying multiple tickets and lets you skip the queue at the main door. The gardens are gorgeous, not as impressive as Kew Gardens in London (I’m biased) but it’s a beautiful setting. As many others have noted there will be swarms of people only there to take Instagram photos but that’s true of most major tourist spots. The house is stunning, the two museums and gallery were highlights of my trip and I shamelessly LOVED the gift shop. The location is beautiful, the staff were lovely and the cafe was lovely if a little bit expensive. I’ve given this 5 stars as the only fly in the ointment is dodging instagrammers so follow others’ advice and go early in the day/evening. If you do get surrounded by cameras you can always just have a chuckle to yourself, watching people take themselves way too seriously and queue to take the same photo smiling at a plant or door as everyone else.",Tip to avoid the queue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2360-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jun 2019 • Friends,,Rebecca F,"London, UK,32 contributions",,"Written July 13, 2019"

A perfect spot for photographs - instagram lovers paradise (you will have to avoid being a photobomber in many peoples instagram pics!).. but overall we were not blown away by these gardens after reading such good reviews, we ate at the small cafe which was nice, but after that we were pretty much ready to go.

So the iconic garden in itself is situated in the Majorelle area, around 20 minute drive from the Médina district. Located right next to the gardens is the YSL fashion museum. Tip: We found the museum experience to be below,par and really not worth the time. Skip the museum & just do the garden tour instead. Only advantage of doing the museum tour inclusive with the gardens is the fact that you get the garden tickets at the museum kiosk & this in turn helps you skip the obtusely long queues for the garden tickets and go straight to the gardens after the museum tour.

2.0,"Majorelle OK, OK, the world knows. Yves St Laurent has given his name to what was formerly known as the Jardins Majorelle. I have been going there since childhood (I am a casablancaise). I always loved the botanic gardens, its mysterious pools, and its secluded corners overrun with bamboos and greenery. Since the advent of St Laurent and his partner Pierre Berge and their coterie of jet setting friends, the gardens have turned into a must see “zoo” of epic proportions. On the day I was there in May, a line of at least 300 people was waiting to get in. Too bad: the magic of the place is greatly diminished, while the ludicrously expensive prices in the Yves St Laurent boutique keep climbing. Don’t expect to see any Majorelle paintings of any note.. they remain hidden in major collections. The Berber museum is interesting if you can elbow your way in. Dommage.

The layout was extremely good with good pathways and seating should you wish to rest with all types of exotic plants, shrubs and trees and wild exotic birds. There is a small restaurant which served traditional cuisine at not to bad a price. The Berber Museum was well worth the money showing the culture, artifacts, jewellery, costumes, weapons etc. You need to spend around 2hrs to appreci.ate the gardens an museum.

I am sure more of the garden was open the first time I visited but I may be mistaken. It took us about 30 mins to walk around the garden but as we were on a time scale to get back on the open top bus tour this was enough time to enjoy the sights.

1.0,The queue into the garden was very long - we were waiting about 30 min in the tough heat. We paid 180 DH each for the combined ticket (gardens and museum roughly £15). As soon as we got in we were waiting to find out what all the fuss is about. The garden/ museum was all a let down for us but it made is appreciate the gardens in England. The garden here wasnt amazing especially as we expected it to be rather 'fashionista' as it's owned by YSL. The garden is full of green cacti and tall trees but couldn't see any colourful exiting plants or garden features.

Great for plant lovers. If you're not into plants or gardens, this isn't the place for you. Costs 70dh to get in. Downside is that it's crazy busy and full of tourists and large tour groups.

5.0,"We took a little trip to Marrakesh while my son is on his gap year from uni. We stayed in the Riad Kechmara (i’ve written a separate review if you want to know more about this superb little garden hotel) We decided to visit the Jardin Marjorelle and walked from the old town to Ru Yves Saint Laurent (the walk from the main Jamaa El’Fna ie the main souk square to the Jardin Marjorelle is pretty much a straight line apart from the left turn at the main traffic lights signposted for Casablanca and then after 50 metres you then make a right into Rue Yves Saint Laurent - will take you about 20-25 mins steady walk) The first thing you notice as you approach this high walled villa is the ever growing queue of folks wanting to get in to this ‘wonder’. The queue actually goes down quite quickly and you might well get approached by the local ‘geezer’ who can offer you direct and quick entry to beat the queues for a few dirhams extra - id say don’t waste your money since the queue moves quickly anyway. So, tickets purchased (a range of tickets available for this place, the berber museum and other locations as a combo offer - we just paid to visit the gardens works out about £6 each. As you go through the entrance way, your mind is literally blown off its hinges by the extraordinary beauty of the lushness and staggering array of stunning plants and trees - pure heavenly oasis. Plants have been brought from all over the world from the most far reaching corners eg Howard islands, mexico - the list is endless. The gardens are so well manicured and looked after, it is so pleasing to know that whilst they did fall into disrepute, that they were then restored to their former glory by Yves Saint Laurent and have been kept in fine form ever since. You will see plants there that defy belief and here they are all happily living next to each other. There is a superb cafe there albeit of course prices are higher than outside, but the service and food are excellent. There is a boutique shop with some stunning silks gowns and Ostrich skin shoes and bags/wallets etc - extremely high class and of course a price to be paid for such quality. i would say you are likely to spend about 1.5-2 hours in there simply wandering around, taking photos, staring at these marvels of nature before stepping out of the side entrance back into the real world.",me and my boy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2680-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,May 2019 • Family,,Gatsbyswing,"London, UK,65 contributions",,"Written May 24, 2019"

So since it is now swamped with people pushing and shoving around to get their perfect photos and videos, it loses all the appeal of beauty and peacefulness that must have made it famous.

Even if you weren’t that interested in the museum, that line was considerably shorter and you can buy tickets for the whole visit there! You can’t go directly into the garden from there but your ticket will help you bypass the long line at the garden. 3. We showed up at the opening time hoping to avoid the worst lines and hopefully the worst heat! So did EVERYONE else!!! We waited for almost an hour.  When we left around noon there was nooooo line! I would rather of been there at noon! Especially to avoid the crowds of instagramers that monopolized every nook and cranny!

5.0,"One of the relatively brief stops we made in Marakech while on our Gate 1 Morocco Allure tour of Morocco was the Jardin Majorelle which is also known as the Yves Saint Laurent garden. This was one of his pet projects and is where he and his life partner, Pierre Berge are interred. It is a beautiful garden filled with exotic plants, especially but not exclusively cacti. It also contains some nice water features, a covered Koi pool and many beautiful flowering plants and trees. Additionally, there also is a small gallery of his love posters which he sent out as Christmas greetings and also a boutique for YSL haute couture and accessories. This is a very quiet and tranquil place in the midst of the bustling city of Marakech. Everyone in our group really enjoyed our visit and it is certainly not a place we would have discovered on our own.

5.0,"Gorgeously designed gardens away from the chaos of the Marrakech Medina. The gardens were created by French Orientalist artist, Jacques Majorelle over nearly 40 years (starting in 1923). In the 1980s the property was bought by fashion desingers Yve Saint-Laurent and Pierre Berge who restored them. I have read that during busier times of the year it might be wise to book tickets in advance as there can be long queues. We went in February which I believe is just before peak season starts and didn’t spend anytime waiting in line for any of the attractions. Tickets are 70 Dirhams (£5.50) per person so not too expensive. You can buy a combined ticket combined with the Yves Saint Laurent museum if you’re doing both (they’re right next to each other).

Itdefinitely was worth any effort, it was very interesting and tranquil. Highly recommended and near the medina. I took the advice of others and got there fairly early. That's the only way to go. We arrived at about 9.15 am and there was barely a queue. We paid by credit card. We booked for the joint ticket with the Yves St Lauren museum. The numbers in the gardens weren't too bad at that time. By the time we left just over an hour later the crowds in the gardens and in the queue outside were so big. And the queue was standing in the sun. The Berber museum (inside the gardens) was very good. I agree with comments from others - explanations in English too would be appreciated. We then went to the Yves St Lauren museum (you exit the gardens and turn left) which was very worthwhile. We didn't expect to appreciate it as much as we did, the building is great as are the exhibits. By the way, the shops in the same street as the gardens (across the road) are very good - there are some great design type stores with set prices.",So glad we went,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2850-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,May 2019 • Couples,,wahinetoaAuckland,"Auckland Central, New Zealand,207 contributions",,"Written May 2, 2019"

3.0,"Well, the garden, once we got in, was quite impressive.  The picture taking is wonderful.  I’ll spare you the blow by blow of our experience, however it can be summed up as extremely frustrating. The signage for the museum is a combination of incorrect information, contradictory and just plain missing.  Further it does not coordinate with the locations' website.   This resulted in a useless 20 minute wait in line.  Trying to buy a ticket for the Berber Museum & Garden (without the St. Laurant museum) was impossible despite the sign 18 inches from the ticket seller (see the picture).  He insisted it was impossible, and when I pointed out the sign, I was told that I could pay the extra $10 USD/per person, start over at another ticket window on a different side (street) of the museum, or go home.  Essentially we were summarily dismissed in a rather rude fashion. A note: we went mid morning  (on the day we were sent away) and the lines were tremendous. Returning the next day (Wednesday) we got there 30 minutes before the ticket booth opened and were able to enjoy the garden before the massive hordes descended.  In retrospect, we were probably lucky we didn’t get in given the massive crowds.   Unfortunately the Berber Museum is closed on Wednesday’s (information provided on just one of the signs around the property, and contradicted on the website); so we missed out on that.  Something I was particularly looking forward to.  HINT:  if you want to take pictures in the garden (and you will even if you think you won't, it's that beautiful), go early or you will be jostling for position to take a picture absent a bunch of strangers.",A series of disappointments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2900-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Apr 2019 • Couples,,Kegan36604,"Mobile, AL,627 contributions",,"Written April 25, 2019"

5.0,This uniquely preserved garden in the heart of Marrakech was lovingly persevered and saved by locals and the fashion designer Yves St. Laurent (as well as his lifelong partner). These gardens and artists' studio showcase the North African tradition of garden design and beautiful living. Can get a little busy once inside the walled garden.  Avoid the temptation to rush through the grounds.  Possibly even see the gardens in reverse to capture some of the plants being lit in a different direction. A real highlight of Marrakech and do make time for this wonderful urban gem if you have time while in Morocco.,Thank God for Yves St. Laurent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or2920-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Jun 2018 • Couples,,Paul DuBois,"London, UK,575 contributions",,"Written April 23, 2019"

We bought the tickets, after almost an hour of waiting, finally we got the tickets and as soon as we enter at 15.55 pm they were saying that the gardens were private and were closed and as such we would only have a small part of the garden to see.  They must inform visitors that from a certain hour we would only have access to a very small garden or at least a reduction price for part of the gardens. They are strategizing to deceive the tourist as soon as they receive the money.  Seven pounds to see palm trees, bamboos and some fishes doesn't worth the money.

4.0,"The gardens are simply breathtaking. Unfortunately, during my visit the Berber museum was closed, but that didn't detract from the complete serenity and beauty of the gardens overall. Many unusual and exotic species of plant invite you to simply stand, take a deep breath in enjoy the experience to its fullest. The only downside for me was the amount of people that were in attendance on the day I went. Even though I was there very early in the year, before the summer rush, there were a great deal of people milling about, just as I was, taking in the amazing scenery. We seemed to get in each others' ways as there was many a faltering to take a picture that could capture the serenity of the place without a plethora of strangers in the shot. A beautiful oasis within a very special city, taking a stroll around the gardens gives you a sense of why the creators loved the area so much.

5.0,"We arrived mid afternoon to find an overwhelming melee of people queueing up to access the garden ... so we aborted and vowed to get up at 7am the next morning to be there for doors opening an 8am. It worked a treat and for thirty glorious minutes we had the place more or less to ourselves. Then it started to fill up and the magic became a little tainted. Other than this, my tips are as follows ... do buy a combined ticket (210 dirhams : circa £16) which gives you access to the great little Berber Museum within the garden ... and, more importantly, the Yves Saint Laurent Museum a hundred metres or so down the road ... absolutely not to be missed ... even if you have zero interest in fashion ... it’s worth it just to see the really lovely modern building ... and the excellent way his life and work has been curated. Do not miss the film either ... fascinating stuff. Finally, do experience the little cafe here ... beautiful setting, nice service, and quality food and drinks. The only odd thing is that the two museums do not open until 10am so one has to spin out rather ones tour of the garden.",All About Yves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3120-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Mar 2019 • Couples,,Smoothguide,"Clapham, London,221 contributions",,"Written April 1, 2019"

5.0,"We had to stand in line outside for half an hour, but the visit to Jardin Majorelle was definitely worth the wait. The Majorelle blue colour of the pavillion made a nice contrast with the green plants and trees, together with the colourful flowers hanging down. It’s a peacefull place to stroll and admire the surroundings. In the cafetaria you can sit in- or outside and enjoy a lovely meal, or just a drink, at a beautiful location. Prices are great. This is a must see when you are in Marrakech. And if you are a fan of fashion king Yves Saint Laurent, you can visit the museum in his memory here too. If you take a taxi to get there, make sure to ask the driver in advance what he charges for the ride. We were almost ripped off, because right before we arrived at our destination he stopped his meter (that showed less than 5 euro) and asked for 20! After a heated discussion, we payed 6 euro. Average tourist price from the Kasbah area til Le Jardin Majorelle is between 5 and 7 euro, and even less for locals. The prices in the boutique were a little outrageous too, but it was a nice shop to see. All in all the gardens are beautiful, peaceful and inspirational.

4.0,"The gardens themselves offer a superbly interesting story of the small man against the system with Yves Saint Laurent preventing the gardens from being turned into an apartment complex. They are quite obviously a huge tourist attractions now, and the gardens have been gradually developed into a full-on jungle paradise. We had to queue to enter and once inside the gardens are really quite stunning, flanked everywhere by the famed Majorelle shade of blue which looks pretty spectacular. We walked into the garden close to the house but fairly quickly lots of staff appeared and everyone was ushered out of that section for an unknown reason which was disappointing. Upon returning I walked past the fish pond and I was dismayed to see a dead fish laying on its side at the bottom which wasn't very nice to see, minus points there. The plants themselves are amazing with countless cacti of variants I have never seen before, plus there are flowers all around. It's hard to enjoy the gardens fully with the immense crowds congesting the area but I suppose this is to be expected. Possibly a timed ticket could help?

When we arrived we saw a huge long queue waiting to buy entrance tickets to the gardens but a very short queue for those with tickets or accompanied by a guide. Some fellow travellers told us to buy the tickets from a small excursion shop (go back to main road and it’s 50m on the left). You buy the ticket for all 3 bits of the tour, he takes you back to the garden entrance and you’re in at the front of the queue.

The garden is beautifully done and it was more of a relaxed environment that we were looking for.

My views might annoy the locals, but I think the enthusiasm for maximum greenery has overwhelmed the structural/ sculptural elements of the garden. It is too lush now, so you don't see the extraordinary outlines of the desert plants as you did some ten years ago. I've no complaints about the huge bamboos as you enter. They're a welcome shift from the intense sun outside. But I deplore the pitch for general greenery of no particular merit as you go round. There are too many people in this space - inevitable at such an iconic destination - but it still moves me.

5.0,If visiting the garden it is definitely worth buying tickets in advance as there is usually a long queue to buy tickets at the gate. However if you walk a further 200 meters to the YSL Museum and buy a joint ticket there usually isn't a queue to enter the museum then go back to the garden and jump the queue. The gardens are a very peaceful and tranquil oasis in a frenetic city and are well worth the visit.,Jump The Queue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Couples,,ge0ffreym28,"Newark-on-Trent, UK,5 contributions",,"Written February 20, 2019"
5.0,We loved it- recommend going to the YSL museum first...buy a ticket for garden and museum together...do the museum first as queues big in the morning for the garden...you can then skip the queue for the garden and get straight in. Really enjoyed the film about YSL in the museum. The garden has a lovely courtyard cafe....amazing plants/cacti,Worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Couples,,travellerscoop,"Horsham, UK,16 contributions",,"Written February 19, 2019"

5.0,A must see on a trip to Marrakech - We bought the combination ticket at the YSL Museum and visited this first. We all enjoyed this beautiful and well presented museum to YSL - especially the display of many Haute Couture outfits on display from over the many decades Nearby are the stunning gardens which are so peaceful after the bustle of the city. A photographers dream - the colours are just amazing Go early to avoid the crowds or later in the afternoon would be a good time too,Stunning gardens!

4.0,"Enjoyed the gardens, the architecture and colors of the studio-now-turned-Berber-museum. Recommend picking a warm day to visit - we went on a cold, rainy day which made it less enjoyable. While in the area: definitely worth to visit Musee Saint Yves Laurent which is located outside the gardens around the corner from the entrance. Consider getting  the combination ticket.",Beautiful gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Family,,Gerd-Hanne_Norway,56 contributions,,"Written February 19, 2019"
5.0,"What a wonderful garden of succulents. We loved every moment of it and have never seen so many cacti in one place! The layout of the gardens coupled with the house of Yves St. Lauent make this a truly magic place, so serene, so calming within the hustle and bustle of the city! We highly recommend a visit (70 dirhams per person).",Outstandingly beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Couples,,Martin M,"Zurich,86 contributions",,"Written February 19, 2019"
4.0,"The garden was a relaxing change of pace to the Marrakech hectic streets. The exotic plants and tree bring fresh air for a relaxing day. There are many colorful aspects to the gardens: plants, vases, building, etc. Our experience took about 1 Hour at a very casual pace. We only visited the gardens and not the museum.",Beautiful and Colorful view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Friends,,Jes,"Germany,45 contributions",,"Written February 19, 2019"
4.0,"Definitely worth a visit while in Marrakesh as it is stunning.   However, contrary to the guidebook description of it being ‘an oasis of calm’, it was very busy when we were there.  Many tourists with selfie sticks more interested in taking photos of themselves than the garden.  However, I would still recommend.",Beautiful garden but crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-or3510-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,Feb 2019 • Couples,,Min T,"Osmington, UK,44 contributions",,"Written February 19, 2019"
